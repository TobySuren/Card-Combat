#Libraries used:
from random import randint #used for picking random numbers for generating cards
from time import sleep #used to add delay to increase tension when playing


#Card list:
#1-9 in red, yellow and blue
#K in white
#round counter in white
#0 in white

#Priority:
#Highest card always wins (W in white beats all), if cards are the same number:
#Red beats yellow
#Yellow beats blue
#Blue beats red
#White beats other colours
